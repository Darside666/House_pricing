# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This project is focused on predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. We leverage a dataset from Kaggle's "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house_prices.git
   cd house_prices
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the `data/` folder.

## Usage

### Data Analysis
Run the notebook `data_analysis.ipynb` to explore the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

### Training the Model
Run the script `scripts/model_training.py` to preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to the `models/` folder:
```bash
python scripts/model_training.py
```

### Making Predictions
Use the script `scripts/predictions.py` to generate predictions on the test dataset:
```bash
python scripts/predictions.py
```

### Visualizations
Refer to `notebooks/data_analysis.ipynb` for visualizations and insights.

## Results
- The trained model is saved as `models/house_price_model.pkl`.
- Predictions are saved in `results/predictions.csv`.

## Requirements
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Refer to `requirements.txt` for the complete list.
